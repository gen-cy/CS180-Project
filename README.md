Break the Bank is a two player, puzzle-platformer intended to recapture the charm of early 2010 web browser video games. Our game features two characters: a janitor and a banker. One player controls the janitor using a,w, and d for movement while the other player plays as the banker using the up,left, and right arrow keys for moving.

### Gameplay
In order to create challenging and entertaining puzzles, we added items that are specific to each player, enemies, and obstacles. For our items, the janitor can pick up the broom which can be used to clean up water spills that the banker cannot touch or else the game ends. The banker can pick up a key which allows the banker to activate elevators. Our enemies are roombas which patrol an area. If either the banker or the janitor are seen by the roomba, the game ends. Lastly, we have a blockade obstacle that can be moved by interacting with its assigned lever. 

To win the game, both players must reach their specific door. Once both players are by their door, the level is complete. As an entertaining bonus challenge, the players can pick up coins to increase their score.
